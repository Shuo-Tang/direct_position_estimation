This project can be separated into two parts:

1. LoE (Loss of Efficiency) calculation to evaluate the performance of robust DPE when there is no interference threats. The calculation restuls are included in the figure below, where we can see that the LoE of DD-RIM (Dual Domain Robust Interference Mitigation) techniques is twice as the one of SD-RIM (Single Domain Robust Interference Mitigation) technique:
