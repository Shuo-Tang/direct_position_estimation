# Direct Position Estimation

Direct Position Estimation (DPE) is a high-sensitivity receiver design, particularly effective in GNSS applications. Unlike traditional methods, the DPE algorithm solves for PVT directly from raw satellite signals, bypassing the need for intermediate quantities like pseudorange and carrier phase. DPE has demonstrated superior performance in terms of precision and robustness, especially in GNSS-challenging environments.

Our initial and "naive" assumption is that traditional positioning techniques developed over past decades can also enhance the existing DPE approach. This repository includes our DPE projects, aimed at enriching the standard DPE with additional features and applications.

## Project Folders

- **`standard_DPE`**: 
  This folder is for the existing standard DPE approach, first proposed by Prof. Pau Closas.

- **`precise_DPE`**:  
  This folder contains the Precise DPE (PDPE) approach, which incorporates carrier phase information into the signal model for enhanced positioning accuracy.

- **`robust_interference_mitigation`**:  
  This folder includes the Robust DPE approach, which utilizes Zero Memory Non-Linearity (ZMNL) filters, such as estimation based on Huber's loss, to improve interference tolerance.

- **`multipath`**:  
  The core concept of DPE provides natural multipath mitigation by fusing satellite information at an early stage. This folder contains plots of multipath error envelopes and an implementation of DPE in realistic multipath environments generated by LMSCM (DLR).

- **`SD_DPE`**:  
  The proposed SD-DPE approach integrates differential GNSS (DGNSS) techniques into the DPE context. Specifically, it leverages the difference between the code delay of the rover and the base station at the signal level, rather than at the observable level, to reduce common errors such as ionospheric and tropospheric errors.
